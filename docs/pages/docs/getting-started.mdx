# Getting Started

<Callout type="info">

Plaiceholder is a server-side library. It will **not** work in the browser.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Under-the-hood, Plaiceholder uses the wonderful and powerful [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to transform images.

Some frameworks or libraries include `sharp` by default, so double-check before you install.

```sh
npm install sharp
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install plaiceholder
```
