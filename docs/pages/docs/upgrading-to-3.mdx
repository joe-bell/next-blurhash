# Upgrading to 3.0

`3.0` marks the end of the `plaiceholder` project, with this major release focussing on making the project feature complete and as future-proof as possible.

Once the `peerDependency` `sharp` [enables support for Non-Node.js projects](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/pull/3522), `plaiceholder` _should_ work seamlessly on all supported runtimes.

Preparing for wider support meant dropping some of the "magic" features that `plaiceholder` previously offered.
There is **no obligation** to upgrade to `3.0` if you would prefer to keep using the previous API!

If this project has been useful to you, please consider [sponsoring my work](https://joebell.co.uk/sponsors).

## Migrate to ESM

<Callout type="info">

**`plaiceholder` packages are [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).**

</Callout>

If you're using any of the `plaiceholder` packages in a CommonJS project, you'll need to migrate to ESM before continuing.

## Update Your Dependencies

Ensure all `plaiceholder` and `@plaiceholder/*` packages are set to at least `3.0.0`.

## Update Your Code

### `plaiceholder`

1. **Implement your own image resolver**

   Previously, `plaiceholder` would automatically resolve your image based on a specified file path or URL, e.g. `getPlaiceholder('./path-to-image')`.

   To enable future adoption within other non-Node.js runtimes, this feature has been removed.

   Instead, **you will need to pass a `Buffer`** to `getPlaiceholder()`, based on your own use-case.

   In the case of Node.js, for local images in `/public`:

   ```js
   import path from "node:path";
   import fs from "node:fs/promises";

   const getImage = async (src: string) => {
     const file = await fs.readFile(path.join("./public", src));
     const buffer = await fs.readFile(file);

     const {
       metadata: { height, width },
       ...plaiceholder
     } = await getPlaiceholder(buffer, { size: 10 });

     return {
       ...plaiceholder,
       img: { src, height, width },
     };
   };

   // Usage
   const { base64, img } = await getImage("/assets/image/example.jpg");
   ```

   In the case of Node.js, for remote images:

   ```js
   const getImage = async (src: string) => {
     const buffer = await fetch(src).then(async (res) =>
       Buffer.from(await res.arrayBuffer())
     );

     const {
       metadata: { height, width },
       ...plaiceholder
     } = await getPlaiceholder(buffer, { size: 10 });

     return {
       ...plaiceholder,
       img: { src, height, width },
     };
   };

   // Usage
   const { base64, img } = await getImage(
     "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621961458348-f013d219b50c?auto=format&fit=crop&w=2850&q=80"
   );
   ```

1. **`blurhash` is no longer returned**

   Switch any `blurhash` consumers to an alternative LQIP strategy, or use the `blurhash` package directly.

1. **`img` â†’ `metadata`**

   Update any `img` consumers to make use of the new `metadata` object.

   Instead, use `metadata` to [create your **own** `<img />` attributes](/docs/usage#generating-img--attributes).

   _Note: `img.type` has moved to `metadata.format`._

1. **No longer `removeAlpha` by default**

   To preserve previous behaviour, you can specify `removeAlpha: true` within `getPlaiceholder()`'s options.

### `@plaiceholder/next`

1. Migrate your `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs`  
   _(or `.ts` when supported)_
1. Ensure your config matches the [configuration steps](/docs/plugins/next).

### `@plaiceholder/tailwindcss`

1. Migrate your `tailwind.config.js` to `tailwind.config.mjs` or `tailwind.config.ts`
1. Follow the [configuration steps to add a `resolver`](/docs/plugins/tailwind).
