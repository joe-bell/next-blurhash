# Getting Started

:::note

Plaiceholder is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library.
It's designed **only** to work in a Node.js environment, **not** the browser.

:::

## Prerequisites

Under-the-hood, Plaiceholder uses the wonderful and powerful [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to transform images.

Some frameworks or libraries include `sharp` by default, so double-check before you install.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install sharp
```

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm install plaiceholder
```
