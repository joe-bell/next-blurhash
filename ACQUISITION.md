# Acquisition

## Why Is This Project Open to Acquisition?

Plaiceholder is a labour of love by [Joe Bell][twitter] â€“ a quest for **the** perfect "low quality image placeholder" (LQIP) solution.

[Joe][twitter] loves to maintain and innovate the project, but is held by the constraints of his day-to-day work and limited free time.

Under a new ownership, Plaiceholder could:

- Innovate at a more consistent and faster pace
- Attract more consumers and contributors
- Attract more customers to your product/business (see below)

## Why Should You Acquire This Project?

> TL;DR If you're a content API or image storage solution, this project is for you.

Content APIs and image storage solutions with on-the-fly image optimization services are growing in popularity, for a good reason; enabling developers to build high-performance pages quickly, with faster build-times.

A lot of these providers don't take into account LQIP generation; which could be fetched on the server/build-time to improve the perceived performance of images used. Plaiceholder's open-source functions could be used under-the-hood to provide that unique functionality, and help you to attract more developers/customers to your service.

## Terms

- All open-source code **must** remain open-source
- Stock options will be considered dependent on the company, but a cash sale (as a B2B transaction) is preferred.
